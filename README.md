# New Delhi Crime Visualization Dashboard

<!-- ![Crime Visualization Dashboard](/data/project-thumbnail.png) -->

Visualization project that features New Delhi Crime Dataset from 2019 to 2021. 

## Dataset

More information about the dataset can be found on [ND Open Data](https://delhipolice.gov.in/statistics).

## Further plans

Since I switched to a specialization track in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I plan on training a Generative ML model on the whole dataset to predict the location and time of potential crimes.
